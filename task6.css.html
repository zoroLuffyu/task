        <h1>Naruto Uzumaki</h1>
        <h2>Seventh Hokage</h2>
         <p>Naruto is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto. It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village. The story is told in two parts: the first is set in Naruto's pre-teen years , and the second in his teens . The series is based on two one-shot manga by Kishimoto: Karakuri (1995), which earned Kishimoto an honorable mention in Shueisha's monthly Hop Step Award the following year, and Naruto (1997).
            Naruto was serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from September 1999 to November 2014, with its chapters collected in 72 tankōbon volumes. Part I of the manga was adapted into an anime television series by Pierrot and Aniplex, which ran for 220 episodes from October 2002 to February 2007 on TV Tokyo; the English dub of the series aired on Cartoon Network and YTV from September 2005 to December 2009. A second series, which adapts material from Part II of the manga, is titled Naruto: Shippuden and ran on TV Tokyo for 500 episodes from February 2007 to March 2017.

            Naruto Uzumaki, the Seventh Hokage of the Hidden Leaf Village, is without a doubt the most powerful shinobi to hold the title. Although his earliest years as a ninja were unimpressive, he slowly but surely built more strength and skill through sheer will and determination.
